# Misty Foglands Mod
## What is this?
This is a Minecraft mod I developed for my Open Source Development class, in which we are able to pick a project to work on throughout the semester that we are interested in. 

I chose to make a Minecraft mod because as someone who has been playing this game for the better part of 10 years, I wanted to combine my knowledge of Java to make something I'm proud of. In addition, I wanted to explore different aspects of Minecraft modding, particularly in the space of world generation.

## What does it add
[WIP]
This mod adds a new dimension named "Misty Foglands" and is meant to be an endgame dimension, after defeating the Ender Dragon. 

## How to run
This is a Fabric based 1.18.2 mod, so using the Fabric loader is necessary to ensure this mod works properly. Once the full version is released, I will update this section of the README.md file, in order to provide more clear description of how to play the mod, as well as where to get the JAR file for it.
